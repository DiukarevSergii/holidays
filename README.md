## Calendar Assignment


#### Description

Please implement a maven library using the Java programming language. The library should have the following:
1. A method to calculate the number of workdays between two given dates (inclusive)
2. A method to set/add holidays and other non-working days
3. Ability to read/write holidays from/to a local JSON file (keep in mind that later we may want to store the holidays somewhere else, for example a database)

#### Example
Given:
* July 1st, 2022 is a holiday
* July 2nd, 2022 is a weekend
* July 3rd, 2022 is a weekend
The number of workdays between June 27, 2022 and July 4th, 2022 is 5.

#### Evaluation points:
1. Object oriented design
2. Code maintainability
3. Unit tests
4. REST API //todo
5. DB integration //todo
6. Integration tests //todo
